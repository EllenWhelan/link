# Sweng Group Project - Hotel Hook
This project was completed as part of a Software Engineering Group Project. This repository contains hotel hook feature that allows a hotel guest to make a booking for childcare during their hotel stay, during the hotel booking process. This is done by a form pop up that redirects to the oogo website. Here the guest can make their childcare booking. 
The luxury-hotel branch of this repository contains the system for another type of hotel, that makes the childcare booking for the guest on behalf of the guest based on the input values on a pop up form. This implementation sends an automated email to the hotel staff to inform them they must make the booking. 

The automated email service is implemented using emailJs. The full emailJs documentation can be found [here](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)

The repository containing the first part of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/EllenWhelan/flex-template-web).

The oogo website can be found [here](https://oogo.herokuapp.com/).




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
